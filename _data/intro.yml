  - description: 
      My name is Lyle and I am a junior at Johns Hopkins, originally from New York. I study Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and related aspects of math and computer science.
    
      Post-graduation, I am deciding between pursuing industry or academia (grad school). This summer, I will intern with Goldman Sachs as an algorithmic/quantitative trader in the Securities Division. I am also conducting research in the Applied Math department and hope to publish a conference paper this summer.
    
      Formally, my academic and professional experiences are listed below.
