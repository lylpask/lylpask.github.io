     - item: I worked as the Director of Events for TCO Labs in 2018, where I was responsible for the [Hatch 2018 Innovation Conference](https://tcolabshatch2018.splashthat.com/). I led a team of 20 students to host a conference with 150 attendees, connecting students with  investors, entrepreneurs and startups.
     - item: Our purpose at TCO is to help the startup scene at Johns Hopkins flourish, and I want to see more Hopkins students to consider entrepreneurship as a career path. Personally, I interned at a local [startup](https://visioninterchange.com/) after my freshman year. It was a formative experience!
