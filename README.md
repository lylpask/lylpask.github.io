About Me
---------
My name is Lyle and I am a junior at Johns Hopkins, originally from New York. I study Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and some [math and computer science](#coursework-and-academic-background) which often coincide with it.

Post-graduation, I am deciding between pursuing industry or academia (grad school). This summer, I will intern with Goldman Sachs as a algorithmic/quantitative trader in the Securities Division. I am also conducting research in the Applied Math department and hope to publish a conference paper this summer.

Formally, my academic and professional experiences are listed below.

Education
---------

**BSc, Applied Mathematics & Statistics**: The Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD), expected May 2020. 
- Minor in Computer Science. Pursuing combined Bachelors/Masters in Applied Mathematics & Statistics, also expected May 2020.
- 3.97/4.0 GPA


Work Experience
----------

**Summer Technology Analyst**, Goldman Sachs & Co.

*New York, NY / May - August 2018*

- Performed data analysis to automate strategic risk assessment of Securities technology.}
- Transformed subjective risk assessments into quantitative insights by conducting PCA, K-means and HCS clustering on a self-built relational model of the firm's technology deployments and business units.
- Incoming algorithmic trading and quantitative finance intern for the Securities Division in Summer 2019.


**Operations Research Consultant**, Whiting School of Engineering

*Baltimore, MD / January 2018 - PRESENT*

- Created season schedules used by entire MiLB leagues. Met challenging client demands from 14+ baseball teams and league officials, through combinatorial optimization.
- Achieved robust solutions 30% more optimal than hand-drawn schedules, in a fraction of the time through integer programming, supercomputing resources, and cutting-edge optimization algorithms.



Coursework and Academic Background
----------
* Applied Mathematics
    * Concentration in statistics. Understand applications and derivations of numerous learning procedures (PCA, SVD, random forest, Spectral Embedding, etc). Some background in statistical theory (performance measures, testing, exponential families, asymptotics). 
    * Significant experience in linear programming for operations research, as described above.
    * Current and future topics of study are Stochastic Processes, Matrix Analysis, and Monte Carlo Methods.

* Math
    * Have a foundation in [real analysis](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~hxu/Math415Syllabus.html). Currently studying functional analysis, with an eye on measure theory to involve myself in probability theory and stochastic calculus. 

* Computer Science
    * Focus on analysis, particularly algorithms.
    * Intermediate background in object-oriented programming (C++/Java) through internship and coursework.


Other Activities
----------
* Entrepreneurship:

     * I worked as the Director of Events for TCO Labs in 2018, where I was responsible for the [Hatch 2018 Innovation Conference](https://tcolabshatch2018.splashthat.com/). I led a team of 20 students to host a conference with 150 attendees, connecting students with  investors, entrepreneurs and startups.
     * Our purpose at TCO is to help the startup scene at Johns Hopkins flourish, and I want to see more Hopkins students to consider entrepreneurship as a career path. Personally, I interned at a local [startup](https://visioninterchange.com/) after my freshman year. It was a formative experience!


* Academic Community
    * I am the Social Chair for the Hopkins Undergraduate Society of Applied Mathematicians (HUSAM). I help bring students and professors of the department together to share advice on classes, research, and careers.
    * Professionally, we have hosted recruiting events for firms including Bloomberg LP, Deloitte, and Marshall Wace just for Applied Math students.
    

* Recreational Running
    * I ran the [Pelham Half Marathon](https://www.athlinks.com/event/158881/results/Event/824001/Course/1453610/Bib/1670) in November 2018. My goal is to race a full marathon by the end of 2020.
