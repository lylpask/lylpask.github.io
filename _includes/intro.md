Hello! My name is Lyle and I am a junior at Johns Hopkins, studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics with minors in math and computer science.

Post-graduation, my interests are split between industry and graduate school. This summer, I will intern with Goldman Sachs as an algorithmic/quantitative trader in the Securities Division. I also conduct research in the Applied Math department and hope to publish a conference paper by summer.

Formally, my academic and professional experiences are listed below.
